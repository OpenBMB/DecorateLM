Compare which text has better structural format. It has better structural format when it has a well-defined structure such as outline format, Markdown, numbered list, bulleted list, JSON, table format, headings and subheadings format or other organizational templates.
First, consider the visual structure of text. Then, only consider the content or logical flow of text.
Your judgement should not be influenced by the language the text is written in, the length of the text and the order in which the texts are presented.
If the texts have similar quality, you should still make a relative judgement and choose the label of the preferred text. 
You must respond with format:
`Choice: 1 or 2\nWhy: reason of choice`

[Text 1]
... {text_1} ...

[Text 2]
... {text_2} ...

Now you have to choose between either 1 or 2. Note that respond only with the format mentioned.

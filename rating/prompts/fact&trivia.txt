Compare which text is contains more facts and trivia. The facts and trivia should be accurate. 
Prefer text which have more number of facts. Put lower priority to facts which contain mathematical calculations and with too deep "concepts and explanations" .
Your judgement should not be influenced by the language the text is written in, the length of the text and the order in which the texts are presented.
If the texts have similar quality, you should still make a relative judgement and choose the label of the preferred text. 
You must respond with format:
`Choice: 1 or 2\nWhy: reason of choice`

[Text 1]
... {text_1} ...

[Text 2]
... {text_2} ...

Now you have to choose between either 1 or 2. Note that respond only with the format mentioned.

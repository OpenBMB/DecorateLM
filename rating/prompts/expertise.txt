Compare which text requires greater expertise and deeper prerequisite knowledge to understand it.
For example, "The relativistic Dirac equation, which combines principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity, predicts the existence of antimatter and elucidates the intrinsic spin of fundamental particles." requires great physics expertise to understand.
Your judgement should not be influenced by the language the text is written in, the length of the text and the order in which the texts are presented.
If the texts have similar quality, you should still make a relative judgement and choose the label of the preferred text. 
You must respond with format:
`Choice: 1 or 2\nWhy: reason of choice`

[Text 1]
... {text_1} ...

[Text 2]
... {text_2} ...

Now you have to choose between either 1 or 2. Note that respond only with the format mentioned.

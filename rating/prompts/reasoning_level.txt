Compare which text has higher reasoning level. It has high reasoning level when it requires more reasoning, logical and mathematical thinking skills or chain of thought thinking.
Your judgement should not be influenced by the language the text is written in, the length of the text and the order in which the texts are presented.
If the texts have similar quality, you should still make a relative judgement and choose the label of the preferred text. 
You must respond with format:
`Choice: 1 or 2\nWhy: reason of choice`

[Text 1]
... {text_1} ...

[Text 2]
... {text_2} ...

Now you have to choose between either 1 or 2. Note that respond only with the format mentioned.

Compare which text has more educational value. It has more educational value if it inclues clear explanations, step-by-step reasoning, or detailed concepts which is clear enough for children to understand. 
Prefer text which has more detailed ideas or explanations which is sufficiently clear to convey them to a child.
Your judgement should not be influenced by the language the text is written in, the length of the text and the order in which the texts are presented.
If the texts have similar quality, you should still make a relative judgement and choose the label of the preferred text. 
You must respond with format:
`Choice: 1 or 2\nWhy: reason of choice`

[Text 1]
... {text_1} ...

[Text 2]
... {text_2} ...

Now you have to choose between either 1 or 2. Note that respond only with the format mentioned.
